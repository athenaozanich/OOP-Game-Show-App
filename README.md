## Goals
  In this project I used Object Oriented Javascript to create a puzzle find the phrase game. Using 'click' event and then real time physical keyboard listeners using 'keyup' event.

  User is dispalyed a set of hidden letters, qwerty keyboard buttons and option to use physical keyboard in order to guess the hidden letters. If the correct guess is made, the hidden letter is shown. In case of incorrect guess, one life is lost. If the user loses 5 lives, the game is Over and user can play again with new phrase.
